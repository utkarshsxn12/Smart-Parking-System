# 🚗 Smart Parking System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Parking System** is a web-based application designed to simplify and optimize vehicle parking management. It automatically allocates the nearest available parking slot, reduces manual effort, and provides a smooth booking and payment experience for users.  
The system focuses on **efficiency, real-time decision-making, and a user-friendly interface**, making it suitable for real-world smart parking scenarios.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🔍 **Automatic Slot Allocation** using DSA logic (Nearest Slot First)
- 🅿️ **Floor-wise Parking Layout** with full slot visibility
- 🔄 **Manual Slot Selection Option** for user flexibility
- 💳 **UPI-based Payment Simulation** with QR code
- ⏱ **Dynamic Parking Charge Calculation** (based on vehicle type & duration)
- 🎨 **Modern & Animated UI** for booking and confirmation
- 📊 **Realistic Workflow** similar to real-world parking systems

---

## 🧠 Data Structures & Logic Used
- **Min Heap / Priority Logic** – Efficient allocation of the nearest available parking slot  
- **Greedy Approach** – Fast decision-making for slot assignment  
- **JavaScript Logic** – Real-time calculation of parking charges

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Backend
- PHP  

### Database
- XAMPP SQL Server  

### Payment (Demo)
- UPI QR Code–based simulated payment flow

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User selects vehicle type and parking duration  
2. System automatically assigns the nearest available slot  
3. User can accept the slot or choose another manually  
4. Parking charges are calculated dynamically  
5. Payment page displays UPI QR code (demo)  
6. Animated booking confirmation is shown
